			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Triggered is a short film about a man's struggle with himself. Kevin finds himself in a tough situation where he must choose. Will he be able to cope with his burgeoning stress?</p>

			<h2>My Team & Role</h2>
		</div>
	</div>
		
	<div class="row">
		<div class = "column_1of2">
			<p>I worked alongside Melissa Campos, Gizelle Pillay and Hanieh Shakeri for a narrative filmaking class. We decided to each take turns taking charge of specific aspects of the film such as sound, directing and filming to maximize our individual learning. As such, my role was shared in preparing logistics, storyboarding editing, directing and filming roughly a quarter of the scenes.</p>

			<h2>Process</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>To start we chose an fun genre: a psychological thriller with a twist.</li>

				<li>Created a shots list with annotations</li>

				<li>Drew out the storyboard</li>

				<li>Aligned our schedules with actors and the team</li>

				<li>Booked all the equipment</li>

				<li>Familiarized ourselves with the camera (lenses, composition, depth, color balance, lighting)</li>

				<li>Began shooting on pre-planned days spread out over a few weeks</li>

				<li>Dumped the footage and began editing</li>

				<li>Recorded audio and then started sound editing</li>

				<li>Finished the final copy and presented</li>

		<h2>Storyboard</h2>
			<p>The storyboard was created after the shots list. It was a great tool for communicating our intentions with each other and teaching staff as well as guiding our execution</p>

		<h2>Shotslist</h2>
			<p>We used the shotslist to stayed on track and make sure ever shot was accounted for accurately with details of the many variables whithin each shot. For example, one of our shots list held the details of the actor, the props to be used, the framing of the scene, the movement of the camera and a description to help visualize.</p>

		<h2>Adversity</h2>
			<p>My team was great and everyone put it a lot of effort and, I can personally say, learned a lot. As with any team, we ran into difficulties such as differences of opinion on composition and style. We would settle our opinions by comparing, contrasting and voting on edits, shots and sounds. One big hurdle we went through was scheduling. Working in a team of 4 crew members and 4 actors involved a lot of planning. The weather was unreliable causing delays on days that would otherwise perfectly set for filming. Nevertheless, we held our heads high and produced.</p>

			<h2>Adversity</h2>
			<p>Our team was great and everyone put their best foot forward. As with any team though, we ran into difficulties such as differences of opinion on composition and style. Nothing was too big as we either tested out our theories and compared or put it to a vote. To be honest, the fact that we cared so much and were open about our opinions and worked through differences made the film better. Another big hurdle we went through was scheduling. Working in a team of 4 and 4 actors involves a lot of planning. Weather itself would delay us on days that would otherwise be perfect for filming. Regardless, we held our heads high and executed.</p>

		<h1>ATA Trade Show Video</h1>
		
	<h2>	Summary</h2>
<p>The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Trade Show Video was displayed on a 4 by 3 8 foot high display at the AAD conference at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center March 1st to 5th 2019. The goal of the video was to promote the products Molescope and DermEngine produced by MetaOptima.</p>

<h2>Process Analysis</h2>
<p>For this project I prepared to create the video by storyboarding, discussing with medical and sales experts on the team, adjusting the storyboard accordingly, saving copies of relevant assets from my previous projects and creating animation assets for the video as needed. I started with a quick storyboard detailing how I planned to present DermEngine and Molescope features in the video. In discussing the audience, message, their needs and how we address them with medical experts on my team. We established that our main audience was dermatologists and the main value we provide for them is improving patient care and increasing efficiency through DermEngine. This workflow involves the first step of imaging a patient, then analyzing the image and lastly, making a diagnostic decision. I then put together first draft for the video using both newly created and previously used assets (animations and shots) which was approved for with minor suggestions for improvement such as repeating the video with DermDrone in the place of the phone utilizing Total Body Photography: an efficient DermEngine feature to image and keep track of multiple lesions on a person’s body. As well I was tasked with moving the MetaOptima logo at the beginning to the top of the screen so it displays at eye-level at the event. In my second round of critique I was asked to add logos at the top of the screen so that people walking by can easily see our branding and establish our brand presence and the event. Overall the process was very strategically organized in starting which was vital in making editing decisions later on. Storyboarding and establishing audience and message allowed me to deeply understand the assets I was making and how I should present them so as to not have to spend time redoing avoidable mistakes.</p>
