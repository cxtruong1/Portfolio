			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			   <p>The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Trade Show Video was displayed on a 4 by 3 8 foot high display at the AAD conference at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center March 1st to 5th 2019. The goal of the video was to promote the products Molescope and DermEngine produced by MetaOptima.</p>

			<h2>Process Analysis</h2>
			<p>For this project I prepared to create the video by storyboarding, discussing with medical and sales experts on the team, adjusting the storyboard accordingly, saving copies of relevant assets from my previous projects and creating animation assets for the video as needed.</p>

			<h2>Storyboard</h2>
			<p>I started with a quick storyboard detailing how I planned to present DermEngine and Molescope features in the video. In discussing the audience, message, their needs and how we address them with medical experts on my team. We established that our main audience was dermatologists and the main value we provide for them is improving patient care and increasing efficiency through DermEngine.</p>

				<figcaption>Dermatology Workflow with DermEngine</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<h2>DermEngine Workflow</h2>	
			<p>This workflow involves the first step of imaging a patient, then analyzing the image and lastly, making a diagnostic decision. I then put together first draft for the video using both newly created and previously used assets (animations and shots) which was approved for with minor suggestions for improvement such as repeating the video with DermDrone in the place of the phone utilizing Total Body Photography: an efficient DermEngine feature to image and keep track of multiple lesions on a person’s body. As well I was tasked with moving the MetaOptima logo at the beginning to the top of the screen so it displays at eye-level at the event.</p>

			<h2>Critique</h2>
			<p>In my second round of critique I was asked to add logos at the top of the screen so that people walking by can easily see our branding and establish our brand presence and the event. Overall the process was very strategically organized in starting which was vital in making editing decisions later on. Storyboarding and establishing audience and message allowed me to deeply understand the assets I was making and how I should present them so as to not have to spend time redoing avoidable mistakes.</p>
