			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>REACH & The Community is a documentary about the organization and the the role they play in providing the community with wholesome healthcare. 

			We take you through REACH's past, when they were first starting in East Vancouver and where they are today: providing exceptional health care for the community. </p>

			<h2>Team & Role</h2>

			<p>My teammates were Melissa Campos and Angelica Lin. My role in the team was to film, create graphics and edit video and sound. My strengths are in creating graphics and editing. 

			During production I was in charge of framing and composing the shot, as well as recording audio and making sure it was clean and clear. If any video overshot I would indicate it to Melissa whom was in charge of conducting the interview so that we could repeat sentences that we needed. </p>

			<h2>Process</h2>


			<ol>
				<li>We began by looking at different potential documentaries as a team and decided on REACH</li>

				<li>We then developed a shots list and a treatment with a moodboard to  determine the look and feel we wanted to convey</li>

				<li>We then storyboarded that specified shot scales, transitions and  framing</li>

				<li>We went to REACH's Annual General Meeting to network and find potential interviewees</li>

				<li>For production days we booked all the equipment</li>

				<li>Familiarized ourselves with the camera (lenses, composition, depth, color balance, lighting)</li>

				<li>Began shooting and sound recording</li>

				<li>Dumped the footage and began editing</li>

				<li>Refined our rough edits, and planned ahead for events and other shots that we needed</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Shooting Interviews</h2>

			<p>We prepared for our interviews by booking and practicing with wireless lavalier mics that the interviewee could wear. It produced clean audio but we during recording we found that we also picked up the sounds of the interviewee's necklaces and watches. When that happened we promptly asked them to repeat themselves. It worked out really well.<br><br>

			For both interviews I was in charge of composition and audio with Angelica taking over during Mike's interview so I could focus on recording video.

			Soft skills such as warming the interviewee up with easy questions were one of the many interview tricks we learned and used. This really brought out the interviewee's character and story as they were more relaxed and themselves. <br><br>


			Melissa was in charge of conducting the interview while I made sure everything went without a hitch and if something was off, I would ensure we redid that scene or question.</p>

			<h2>Storyboard</h2>

			<p>This was one of our initial storyboards which changed as complications with who we could interview changed. However, it gave us a really good structure and way to hold our ideas together. Even in this early iteration, we can see the same use of expositions shots and overall transitions as in the final. Subjects did change, but the overall feel and message remained the same and successfully so. </p>

			<h2>Montage: 3D Ken Burns Effect</h2>

			<p>I made the icons and the graphics for the 3D ken burns effect and then edited the effects to fit the video. The idea was to give the old images of REACH life and convey a sense of how far REACH has come. <br> <br>

To make the cut-outs I used Photoshop easy-masking tool and the lasso tool for finer details. <br> <br>

I then threw it into After Effects where I used the scaling of position of the layers to create a 3D effect that brings the photo to life.  <br> <br>

For editing, color was considered as we started with black and white photographs and moved toward color so that the montage would not be jarring and ease back into color.  </p>

			<h2>Icons and Animation</h2>

			<p>For the icons I traced the logos from the REACH website so that it would remain consistent with the graphic language already present on the website. <br><br>

			Additionally I made a logo representing the new REACH building which we didn't end up using. However, it did resemble the building really well. <br><br>
			The graphics were used to quickly and abstractly convey different service REACH could provide for them as they are watching the video. </p>

			<h2>Difficulties</h2>

			<p>One of the big difficulties we had was that we did not get the interviews we set out to get. This was because there were other teams working on the same subject and interviewees only had so much time. We worked through this by using the interviews we got from Mike and Afshin which we perfectly in depth and carried the narrative. We adjusted our story accordingly and it worked out well.</p>

			<h2>Editing</h2>

			<p>For editing, we used Adobe Premiere, After Affects and Audition. It was a team effort as Melissa & Angelica transcribed the words and sentences. Melissa then organized words and sentences into a narrative that really communicated a community narrative interestingly. <br><br>

			For the first rough edit, Angelica but together the initial shots and handed over to me to refine. Some shots had to be replaced and paced to better flow with the story. <br><br>

			As well, I made the poster, the graphics and editing for the 3D effect on the old pictures of REACH and traced the logos manually from the REACH website so that they would be unified with REACH's brand. <br><br>

			The final edit was not too different and was revised by all of us separately, and then one last time together so that we were all happy with it. The audio was done together as a group as we normalized the audio of the voice to be clear and brought the background music down so that it would not dominate the piece with Adobe Audition.</p>

			<h2>Result/h2>

			<p>Overall I am very happy with the end result as the video and audio came out great. If I were to do it again I would definitely reframe the interview subjects so that there is less head space to address the composition issues I came to realize afterwards.  <br><br>
  			The audio was very clean and the levels were just right, allowing for the voice to carry the story. I am also happy with my own contributions as I expanded my skills in many regards such as audio and video editing, composition and pacing, sound recording and especially interviewing skills. </p>

		<h2>Adversity</h2>
			<p>My team was great and everyone put it a lot of effort and, I can personally say, learned a lot. As with any team, we ran into difficulties such as differences of opinion on composition and style. We would settle our opinions by comparing, contrasting and voting on edits, shots and sounds. One big hurdle we went through was scheduling. Working in a team of 4 crew members and 4 actors involved a lot of planning. The weather was unreliable causing delays on days that would otherwise perfectly set for filming. Nevertheless, we held our heads high and produced.</p>

			<h2>Adversity</h2>
			<p>Our team was great and everyone put their best foot forward. As with any team though, we ran into difficulties such as differences of opinion on composition and style. Nothing was too big as we either tested out our theories and compared or put it to a vote. To be honest, the fact that we cared so much and were open about our opinions and worked through differences made the film better. Another big hurdle we went through was scheduling. Working in a team of 4 and 4 actors involves a lot of planning. Weather itself would delay us on days that would otherwise be perfect for filming. Regardless, we held our heads high and executed.</p>

		<h1>ATA Trade Show Video</h1>
		
	<h2>	Summary</h2>
<p>The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Trade Show Video was displayed on a 4 by 3 8 foot high display at the AAD conference at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center March 1st to 5th 2019. The goal of the video was to promote the products Molescope and DermEngine produced by MetaOptima.</p>

<h2>Process Analysis</h2>
<p>For this project I prepared to create the video by storyboarding, discussing with medical and sales experts on the team, adjusting the storyboard accordingly, saving copies of relevant assets from my previous projects and creating animation assets for the video as needed. I started with a quick storyboard detailing how I planned to present DermEngine and Molescope features in the video. In discussing the audience, message, their needs and how we address them with medical experts on my team. We established that our main audience was dermatologists and the main value we provide for them is improving patient care and increasing efficiency through DermEngine. This workflow involves the first step of imaging a patient, then analyzing the image and lastly, making a diagnostic decision. I then put together first draft for the video using both newly created and previously used assets (animations and shots) which was approved for with minor suggestions for improvement such as repeating the video with DermDrone in the place of the phone utilizing Total Body Photography: an efficient DermEngine feature to image and keep track of multiple lesions on a person’s body. As well I was tasked with moving the MetaOptima logo at the beginning to the top of the screen so it displays at eye-level at the event. In my second round of critique I was asked to add logos at the top of the screen so that people walking by can easily see our branding and establish our brand presence and the event. Overall the process was very strategically organized in starting which was vital in making editing decisions later on. Storyboarding and establishing audience and message allowed me to deeply understand the assets I was making and how I should present them so as to not have to spend time redoing avoidable mistakes.</p>
